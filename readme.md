# Project Title

Unscripted Scribbles

## Overview

Unscripted Scribbles is a digital trash can that homes a myriad of expressions; thoughts, experiences, perspectives, contemplations, questions, etc... It's a blog.

### Problem

I have a habit of buying too many notebooks, only to leave them half-used and collecting dust. I also waste more paper than Iâ€™d like to admit. With inflation pinching my wallet and my penchant for paper wasting, I need a budget-friendly, eco-conscious solution. Enter: a much needed digital platform.

### User Profile

- Me:
  - I'll use the app to write and share.
