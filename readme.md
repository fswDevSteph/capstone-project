# Project Title

The Blog

## Overview

The Blog is a digital trash can that homes a myriad of expressions; thoughts, experiences, perspectives, contemplations, questions, etc... It's a blog - for now.

### Problem

I have a habit of buying too many notebooks, only to leave them half-used and collecting dust. I also waste more paper than Iâ€™d like to admit. With inflation pinching everybody's wallet and my penchant for paper wasting, I need a budget-friendly, eco-conscious solution to write. Enter: a much needed digital platform. Oh! And, I hired someone to create a blog for me but somehow my information got into hackers hands and I became a victim of fraud to the tune of 4g so, I decided to learn how to build software myself.

### User Profile

- Me:
  - I'll use the app to write and share.
- Readers:
  - Will use the app for entertainment, to love or hate, criticize or relate. Maybe no one will use it all! Regardless, to each their own.

### Features

- As a user, I want a blog that only I can post blogs to
- As a user, I want home, about and blog page
- As a user, I want my homepage to show some blogs
- As a user, I want my blogs to have a title, text content, date stamp, author and image
- As a user, I want readers to be able to like a blog post
- As a user, I want to subscribe to an email letter
- As a user, I want to contact the blog by email and receive a reply
- As a user, as the blogger, I just want to run a script to create or delete posts.
