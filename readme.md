# Project Title

Unscripted Scribbles

## Overview

Unscripted Scribbles is a digital trash can that homes a myriad of expressions; thoughts, experiences, perspectives, contemplations, questions, etc... It's a blog - for now.

### Problem

I have a habit of buying too many notebooks, only to leave them half-used and collecting dust. I also waste more paper than Iâ€™d like to admit. With inflation pinching everybody's wallet and my penchant for paper wasting, I need a budget-friendly, eco-conscious solution to write. Enter: a much needed digital platform.

### User Profile

- Me:
  - I'll use the app to write and share.
- Readers:
  - Will use the app for entertainment, to love or hate, criticize or relate. Maybe no one will use it all! Regardless, to each their own.

### Features

- As a user, I want a blog that only I can post blogs to
- As a user, I want home, about and blog page
- As a user, I want my homepage to show some blogs
- As a user, I want my blogs to have a title, text content, date stamp, author and image
- As a user, I want readers to be able to like a blog post
- As a user, I want to subscribe to an email letter
- As a user, I want to contact the blog by email and receive a reply
- As a user, as the blogger, I just want to run a script to create or delete posts.

### Endpoints examples

--implementation:

1. Add a resized img to upload folder (backend>uploads)
2. Navigate to upload script (backend>insertSinglePostData.js)
3. Paste edited blog content into respective fields (make sure to edit file image name for seo and the extension so it matches what is in the uploads folder)
4. run 'node insertSinglePostData.js' in terminal to add data to DB and verify it renders on page.
5. You can inspect the post in the browser to get the post ID and delete a post using the script that way but if you have access to compass that is much more time effective.

HTTP Method: POST
Endpoint: /api/posts/:id/like
Description: Likes a specific blog post by its ID.

**Set a Post as Featured:**
HTTP Method: PUT
Endpoint: /api/posts/set-featured/:id

**Delete a Post:**
HTTP Method: DELETE
Endpoint: /api/posts/:id
Description: Deletes a specific blog post by its ID when running the script. Though, since you probably have compass open, just click delete in the GUI on the post you want to remove.
